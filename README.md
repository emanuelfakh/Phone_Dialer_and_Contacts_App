# mobile_dialer_and_contacts_App

NOTE: I shall be uploading the Code in due course. Just tied up with a few other things. Thanks

A mobile app which enables you to dial a number and add, edit or delete contacts. The app was built in Android Studio.

NOTE: The app needs to be run in Android Studio's EMULATOR and the number you dial is displayed as "calling", i.e., it does not actually call a real number as that requires infrastructure beyond the scope of this project. You will however receive validation messages for dialing an incorrect number (e.g. if a mobile number is less than 11 digits). You will be able to create, edit and delete a contact just like a normal mobile phone.

Please READ THROUGH the "Report_with_Explanation_GitHub" word file to see instructions for using the app and well as understand the approach to developing it in Android Studio. You will find it very helpful.
